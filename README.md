# Crowdfunding-ETL

### Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to perform an ETL ('Extract, Transform, Load') process using Python in Jupyter Notebook and SQL in pgAdmin 4 to create and export a series of .CSV files containing particular information in a readable format extracted from a corpus of data regarding numerous crowdfunding projects.  This process constitutes a form of data analysis whereby disparate datasets containing some common indices are positioned into a database and thereby joined and/or compared to produce synthetic results that could not be reached otherwise.
